# DNS Ingress Module

This module prepares DNS and TLS resources for ALB-backed application and
platform ingress.

## Resources

- Looks up an existing public Route 53 hosted zone.
- Creates an ACM certificate for the application hostname.
- Adds subject alternative names for additional hostnames such as Argo CD,
  Grafana, Prometheus, and any public service dashboards.
- Creates Route 53 DNS validation records.
- Waits for ACM certificate validation.

## Hostname Model

The main app hostname is:

```text
<app_subdomain>.<root_domain_name>
```

Additional hostnames are created from:

```text
<additional_subdomain>.<root_domain_name>
```

The dev root passes Argo CD, Grafana, Prometheus, `eureka`, and `discovery` as
additional names. The prod root passes Argo CD, Grafana, and Prometheus. Zipkin
uses a separate instance of this module so exposing it does not replace the
shared platform certificate.

## Inputs

Important active inputs:

- `environment`
- `root_domain_name`
- `app_subdomain`
- `additional_subdomains`
- `certificate_name`
- `aws_region`
- `tags`

The module also accepts EKS and load balancer related inputs
(`cluster_name`, `cluster_endpoint`, `cluster_ca_certificate`,
`lb_controller_service_account`) for compatibility with earlier designs, but the
current resources do not create Kubernetes ingress objects here.

## Outputs

- `route53_zone_id`
- `root_domain_name`
- `app_domain_name`
- `additional_domain_names`
- `acm_certificate_arn`
- `acm_certificate_validation_id`
- `hosted_zone_name_servers`

## Relationship To Add-Ons

This module creates the certificate. The `addons` module uses the certificate
ARN to expose Argo CD, Grafana, and Prometheus through ALB ingresses. A separate
instance provides the Zipkin certificate. The service Helm chart can expose
application services through ALB ingresses when ingress values are enabled.
